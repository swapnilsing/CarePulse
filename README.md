 ML Powered Early Detection for Alzheimer's Disease

CarePulse is a specialized platform that utilizes advanced Machine Learning to analyze clinical and imaging data, providing healthcare professionals with a powerful tool for the early prediction and risk assessment of Alzheimer's disease. Our mission is to empower clinicians with data-driven insights to facilitate timely intervention and improve patient outcomes.


üöÄ Key Features

-   Multi-Modal Data Analysis: Employs sophisticated ML models to analyze a combination of data sources, including MRI scans, cognitive test scores (e.g., MMSE, CDR), and genetic markers (e.g., APOE4 status).
-   Predictive Risk Scoring: Generates a clear, probabilistic risk score indicating the likelihood of Alzheimer's onset or progression.
-   Clinician-Centric Dashboard: Presents predictive insights, key biomarkers, and patient data trends through an intuitive and secure dashboard designed for medical professionals.
-   Longitudinal Tracking: Monitors cognitive changes over time by analyzing data from multiple patient visits to track disease progression.
-   Explainable AI (XAI): Provides insights into which features (e.g., hippocampal volume, test scores) most heavily influenced the model's prediction, aiding in clinical interpretation.
-   HIPAA Compliant:Built with a security-first approach to ensure the utmost privacy and protection of sensitive patient health information.

üßë‚Äçüíª Technologies Used

-   Machine Learning: Python (TensorFlow/PyTorch for imaging, Scikit-learn for clinical data)
-   Frontend: React.js
-   Backend: Node.js, Express.js
-   Database: MongoDB (for clinical data), with secure storage solutions for medical images.
-   Image Processing: Libraries like NiBabel and OpenCV for handling MRI data.


üí° Why Early Detection of Alzheimer's Matters

An early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's is critical. It allows patients and their families to plan for the future, manage symptoms more effectively, and gain access to emerging clinical trials and therapies. CarePulse provides a crucial tool to support neurologists and geriatricians in making these timely, life-altering diagnoses.



üèóÔ∏è How It Works

1.  Secure Data Upload: A healthcare professional securely uploads patient data, including MRI scans, demographic information, and cognitive assessment results.
2.  AI-Powered Analysis:The platform's ML pipeline processes the multi-modal data. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) analyzes imaging data while an ensemble model assesses clinical and genetic information.
3.  Risk Assessment:The system integrates the analyses to generate a comprehensive risk report and a predictive score.
4.  Actionable Insights: The results are displayed on the clinician's dashboard, highlighting key risk factors and progression trends.



üìä Example Use Cases

-   Assisting neurologists in differentiating Alzheimer's from other forms of dementia.
-   Identifying high-risk individuals for participation in preventative clinical trials.
-   Providing quantitative data to support a clinical diagnosis.
-   Monitoring the cognitive health of at-risk populations over time.



üè• Target Audience

-   Neurologists, Geriatricians, and Radiologists
-   Hospitals and specialized Memory Clinics
-   Pharmaceutical companies and Clinical Research Organizations
